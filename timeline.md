Started at the wrong time (tail-end of the project) but it would have held logs of what I was doing.. content for the blog post ðŸ˜‰

Well, I achieved a working project yesterday and put in [Plausible analytics](https://plausible.io) on the live site today. Will be closing the project here.

There are a number of improvements I could make to it, such as loading indicators, caching and mosr stuff I could probably think of. But that won't be.

I'm considering this project **finifshed** and moving on to something else. I'm thinking a chat app.
